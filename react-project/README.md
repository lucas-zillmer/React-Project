Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/adrianhajdin" target="_blank"> https://github.com/adrianhajdin </a> for the excellent course on developing in React and TailWind CSS, and Hoobank for the beautiful UI/UX Design. This was a fun and learningful experience!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
